     * Extracts a timestamp from a record. The timestamp must be positive to be considered a valid timestamp.
     * Returning a negative timestamp will cause the record not to be processed but rather silently skipped.
     * In case the record contains a negative timestamp and this is considered a fatal error for the application,
     * throwing a {@link RuntimeException} instead of returning the timestamp is a valid option too.
     * For this case, Streams will stop processing and shut down to allow you investigate in the root cause of the
     * negative timestamp.
     * <p>
     * The timestamp extractor implementation must be stateless.
     * <p>
     * The extracted timestamp MUST represent the milliseconds since midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC.
     * <p>
     * It is important to note that this timestamp may become the message timestamp for any messages sent to changelogs
     * updated by {@link KTable}s and joins.
     * The message timestamp is used for log retention and log rolling, so using nonsensical values may result in
     * excessive log rolling and therefore broker performance degradation.
     *
     * @param record            a data record
     * @param previousTimestamp the latest extracted valid timestamp of the current record's partitionË™ (could be -1 if unknown)
